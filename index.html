          <h3>Did you know?</h3>
          <p>You're not alone if you find Git intimidating. Git was originally created ten years ago by Linus Torvalds, the inventor of Linux, to track changes to the Linux kernel. Initially, it received a somewhat skeptical response, as even Google's engineers claimed it was "expressly designed to make [us] feel stupid."</p>

          <h2>1. Virtualization Overview</h2>
            <h3>What is Virtualization?</h3>
         
          <p>The contemporary workplace relies on traditional workstation/file server computing environments in which files are stored on a company server and each worker uses a workstation to access and change those files. The workstations do the computing, and the file server acts as a receptacle. This structure is inefficient, placing power-hungry workstations at every desk, creating a high degree of unused computing overhead (see figure 1).</p>
            <p>Virtualization refers to the process of abstracting and presenting a virtual representation of computer hardware in order to allow a centralized server (called a hypervisor) to simultaneously divide its heavy computing power between multiple external, low-power computers called thin clients, each of which interacts with the virtual hardware allocated to it. This allows the server to run all of the computing tasks and allows the client to maintain a passive role. This centralizes the computing needs of an organization, allowing for accurate scaling according to actual rather than projected needs. It is the most power-efficient way to provide computing resources to an organization (see figure 2).</p>
            
            <h3>Why RPiTC2?</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> leverages the low cost and low power consumption of ARM-processor-based mobile phone platforms and reconfigures them into a small-footprint, general-purpose computer appropriate for experimentation and prototyping. Until now, the problem has been that although the Pi is powerful, it cannot efficiently run fully-featured operating systems with memory-hungry GUIs. RpiTC's solution is to use the Pi as a thin client, offloading the computing power to a hypervisor.</p>
            <p>Because the Pi is so inexpensive and RpiTC2 is free and open-source, the savings over even the least expensive commercially-available thin clients are tremendous. For large enterprises buying in volume, the cost of the Pi is low enough to be considered disposable. For users who need smaller scale deployments, Pis represent the most cost-effective way to move to a thin-client computing environment.</p>
            <h3>Why KVM?</h3>
            <p>There are many commercial offerings in the hypervisor marketplace. Xen and KVM, by contrast, are open-source hypervisors that are as fully-featured as commercial equivalents offered by VMWare and Microsoft. For organizations running critical systems, enterprise-level support contracts are available from Citrix, Xen's parent company. For those who do not need support contracts, the product is free. KVM, by contrast, does not offer support contracts and is fully open source, developed by the Open Virtualization Alliance. For the limited scope of this project, we have chosen KVM.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Planning your Deployment</h2>
            <h3>Assess your Needs</h3>
            <p>If you are creating your thin-client network at home, this section will be less important. If you are creating a test environment at work and are concerned about appropriate resource allocation, you should take care to plan your deployment using this guide.</p>
            <h3>Calculate Necessary Hardware Specifications</h3>
            <p>There are two main computing resources that need to be carefully allocated in a virtual environment: RAM and processor power. Of the two, RAM is significantly more important, and will determine the absolute limit of virtual hosts possible. As a general rule, you should acquire and install the most RAM you can afford on your server. In our lab, we are working with a Thinkserver TS140, which has a maximum RAM capacity of 32GB. If we want each of our thin clients to use 2GB of RAM, and we want to reserve 8GB for the server to use, you can see that we can run a maximum of 4 thin clients. This is a very conservative allocation plan that will ensure that a large amount of overhead is available. For an initial testing environment, this is fine. As you progress into final testing stages, you will begin optimizing resources and incrementally increasing the number of clients to achieve the best balance of client and server performance.</p>
            <p>Note: about RAM and 32-bit processors</p>
            
            <h3>Plan your Network Topography</h3>
            <p>As seen in figure 1b above, the minimum hardware requirements for a thin client network are:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>An Ethernet or WiFi network attached to a router</li>
              <p>Note: wired vs. wireless connectivity and throughput</p>
            <li>A server</li>
            <li>At least one client</li>
          </ul> 
          
          </hgroup>
